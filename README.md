# AI Evolution Sim

A simulation of AI agents with neural network brains, evolving through natural selection in a 2D grid world.

## Features
- Pygame-based world with food, water, and terrain
- Agents perceive a 3x3 grid using basic vision
- Neural network "brains" using PyTorch
- Softmax-based stochastic movement (pseudo free-will)
- Future: Evolution, prophet injection, memory, and language

## Requirements

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```
